                <p>Pre Activity</p>
                    If the sprayer has been previously used with a different product make sure that it is
                    washed thoroughly first. The dilution ratio for spot spraying is 50:1. Add 200ml of
                    concentrated product into the measuring phial located in the mouth of the spray pack.
                    Add water to the spray tank until the 20 litre mark has been reached.
                <p>During Activity</p>
                    Both hard areas and soft areas can be treated with this product. Be aware of drift as
                    neighbouring plants may be affected. Do not over apply. <em>One drop kills</em>.
                <p>Post Activity</p>
                Complete the Pesticide Spray Record sheet.
                Replace weed killer, spray suit and sprayer in chemical cupboard.
